# monitor

The monitor solution consists of two projects, `api` and `webapp`. Refer to the [`webapp` README](webapp/README.md) for more information about that project.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Getting Started

### Database Setup

### `api` Project

After cloning the project, navigate into the `api` directory in a command line terminal.

Run `npm install` to get project dependencies.

TypeScript has been configured for the `api` project and it is currently being converted from JavaScript.

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the project into the `build/` directory.

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

Starts the server and defaults to listen on port 8000.
